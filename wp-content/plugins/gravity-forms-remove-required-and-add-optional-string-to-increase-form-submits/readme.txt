Dont show required *, but places an extra text after elements that are optional.

== Description ==

Users don't want to do something that is required from a usability perspective. Especially not in forms. You want your conversion be as high as possible. When you use Gravity Forms and install this plugin we remove all * for required fields and add an optional string for optional fields. You can add whatever string you want if you don't like our (optional).

We even add your own gform_optional class so you can style it any way you want, just like you could with the gform_required class.
